# Sewer sediment deposition prediction

The repository encapsulates the code that generates a two-phase machine learning model, combining an autoencoder to reduce the dimensionality 
of physical (and static) features of sewer pipes, and an artificial neural network that combines the reduced features with dynamic to classify 
future sediment occupation ranges.
The development has been conducted within the project SCOREwater. This project has received funding from the European Unionâ€™s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme under grant agreement no 820751. A paper explaining the study behind the code is on the way.
